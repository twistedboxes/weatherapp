Refactoring (Correct HTML too) -> Convert to OOP -> Add Dark Mode

Missing fixes:

// Done // 1. Icon doesn't change based on wmo - implement switch/case

// Done // 2. Add icons in last row before each element

// Done // 3. Dark mode

4. Allow user to create up to two more cards (total 3) to compare weather conditions between different locations
